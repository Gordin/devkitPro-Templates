Make sure DEVKITPRO and DEVKITARM are set in your environment

WORKSPACE:
Using the workspace will make code-completion available

1. Copy the workspace folder and name it devkitARM

2. Rename devkitARM.workspace.USER to devkitARM.workspace.YOUR_USERNAME

EXTERNAL TOOLS: (project independent)
The tools start your project in desmume in normal or debug mode with one click

1. Find your codelite.xml (under linux it's ~/.codelite/config/codelite.xml)

2. In codelite.xml search delete the block
    <ArchiveObject Name="ExternalTools">
    ...
    </ArchiveObject>
This will delete all your settings for external tools. If you have defined
own tools and want to keep them you will have to merge the next part with
your Tools manually.

3. Replace the block you deleted with the content of tools.xml

PROJECT:

1. Copy the project-template folder and rename it to YOUR_PROJECTNAME
YOUR_PROJECTNAME has to be the same in all steps

2. Rename template.project to YOUR_PROJECTNAME.project

3. Edit YOUR_PROJECTNAME.project and change
    1.  <CodeLite_Project Name="template" InternalType="devkitARM">
        to
        <CodeLite_Project Name="YOUR_PROJECTNAME" InternalType="devkitARM">

    2.  DebuggerPath="${DEVKITARM}/bin/arm-eabi-gdb"
        to
        DebuggerPath="YOUR_ACTUAL_DEVKITARM_PATH/bin/arm-eabi-gdb"

        --- You have to replace this TWICE! ---

        (the variable should work but codelite has a bug that does not start
        the debugger when you use the variable in the path)

Now you can open the workspace in codelite and add the project to it.
